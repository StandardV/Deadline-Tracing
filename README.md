### Deadline-Tracking

## Introduction

  As a college student, I've always been struggling with deadline, taking course and work-load, sometime hybrid or remotely if what you're doing are not well thought enough, or that your professor doesn't lay out what they wanted you to do completely, then there's a really high chance that you would missed some or a lot of assignment.
  HERE I INTRODUCE TO YOU A BREAKTHROUGH: THE LIFE-CHANGER 3000
  
  Jk, it's not that much of a life changer if you're not using it right, but I'm guarantee it will change your life if you're organized enough. That said, I've decided to make a deadline-tracking script by myself since it's easier to customize everything, it give me what I need and I can also learn a lot in the process of doing it too.

## Deadline Tracker

  Here's an example of how it would look like when you first open it (exclude the cengage thing, it's my own deadline)

  Now, how will it work, it's pretty simple, you just need to install it, properly changing absolute path in the code (with details from Intruction and Note file) then you can start using it immediately. 
  
  That said, here's the requirement of what you need to have on your system (since I'm not using docker, you will have to satisfy the requirement yourself)
    Python
    Tkinter (gennerally built-in, so if you have python, tkinter should be in there too)
    Datetime (gennerally built-in, so if you have python, datetime should be in there too)
    
    So yes, the only requirement is python!!!
    
# Just a quick look of how will it notify the deadline

    *Press add to add value
  
  Insert value in a preset format for better tracking (This format can be changed and will be note in the Intrustion and Note file)

    *Insert and press change time while tick on the selected box to change value
    
   Press format for different ways of tracking (literally just press format ;D )

    *It's REDDDDDDDD (on the deadlineday) and notify hours!!!
    
    
    
  
  # Personal Enhance Recomendation
  *Adding different page instead of scroll bar allowing to keep track of more value instead of limited value on screen
  *Alarm that notify user by sound or phone notification when the time come
  *Enhanced in UI
  *Different ways of sorting value
  
  
  All of these seem interesting but not what I need right now, therefore I won't make it, you can do it yourself since I've already lay out the idea here or if you're interested, you could contact me and I'll do it for you XD ( not free of course ). Cheers!!!
